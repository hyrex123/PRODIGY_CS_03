# Password Strength Checker

This Python script serves as a straightforward password strength checker, assessing the strength of a provided password based on specified criteria. 
The criteria include a minimum length of 8 characters, the presence of at least one uppercase and lowercase letter, at least one number, and at least one special character. 
To use the script, clone the repository, navigate to the directory, and run the script with Python.
Enter a password when prompted, and the script will output whether the password is weak or strong based on the defined criteria.
The `check_password_strength` function conducts the necessary checks, returning a message indicating the strength or specific weakness of the password. 
The script's example usage demonstrates how to integrate the password strength checker into your projects or customize it as needed.
